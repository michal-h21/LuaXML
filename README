Introduction
------------

The odsfile is LuaLaTeX package and lua library for reading opendocument spreadsheet (ods) documents from Open/Libre Office Calc and typeseting them as LaTeX tables. 
This package uses LuaTeX's zip library and scripting to read these files, 
which means that it is not possible to use this package with pdfLaTeX or XeLaTeX. On the other side, odsfile.lua library
can be used from PlainTeX, ConTeXt or pure lua scripts.

It may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions of the
LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL), either version 1.3c of this license or
(at your option) any later version. The latest version of this license is in

2005/12/01 or later.
